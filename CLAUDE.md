# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a GitHub profile repository (`mahmoodhamdi/mahmoodhamdi`). It contains a special `README.md` that displays on the owner's GitHub profile page. The profile is heavily visual with animated SVGs, stats badges, and auto-generated contribution graphs.

## GitHub Actions Workflows

### Snake Animation (`snake.yml`)

- Generates snake animation from contribution graph
- Runs every 12 hours and on push to main
- Outputs to `output` branch as `github-snake.svg` and `github-snake-dark.svg`

### WakaTime Stats (`waka-readme.yml`)

- **Status:** Not currently used in README (no markers present)
- Configured to update coding stats in README between `<!--START_SECTION:waka-->` and `<!--END_SECTION:waka-->` markers
- Runs daily at midnight UTC
- **Requires:** `WAKATIME_API_KEY` secret (get from wakatime.com/settings/api-key)
- Configuration: Shows last 7 days, top 6 languages, uses Dart syntax highlighting with block characters (░▒▓█)

### 3D Profile (`profile-3d.yml`)

- Generates 3D contribution graph using `yoshi389111/github-profile-3d-contrib@0.7.1`
- Runs daily at midnight UTC and on push to main
- Outputs to `profile-3d-contrib/` directory (multiple theme variants generated)
- Auto-commits generated SVG files with bot credentials (github-actions[bot])
- README displays the `profile-night-rainbow.svg` variant

## README.md Structure & Content

The README is organized into the following sections:

1. **Header**: Name, title, and social badges (LinkedIn, Email, WhatsApp, GitHub)
2. **About Me**: Brief bio highlighting Full-Stack specialization, current work at ROV GROUP/Escore, and MENA region focus
3. **Core Competencies**: Three main areas - Mobile Development, Backend Engineering, Data & Infrastructure
4. **Technical Stack**: Badge-based display of languages and frameworks/tools
5. **GitHub Statistics**: Stats cards, streak stats, top languages (using github-readme-stats)
6. **Activity**: Snake animation from contribution graph (auto-generated)
7. **Featured Projects**: Pinned repository cards for select projects
8. **Services Offered**: List of professional services (Mobile, Backend, Database, Web Scraping, Consultation)
9. **Contribution Graph**: 3D contribution visualization (auto-generated)
10. **Let's Connect**: Contact information footer with profile view counter

All external service URLs use a consistent dark theme with cyan (`#00D9FF`) and red (`#FF6B6B`) accent colors.

## Common Modification Tasks

### Updating Profile Content

- **Tech stack badges**: Update the language and framework badges in the "Technical Stack" section
- **Contact info**: Update social badges in header and "Let's Connect!" section footer
- **Core competencies**: Modify the bullet points under Mobile Development, Backend Engineering, and Data & Infrastructure
- **Services offered**: Edit the bulleted list in "Services Offered" section
- **Featured projects**: Update pinned repo cards by changing repository names in the GitHub stats API URLs
- **Current work**: Update "About Me" section to reflect current position and focus areas

### Workflow Management

- **Manually trigger workflows**: Use `workflow_dispatch` event in GitHub Actions UI
- **Test workflow changes**: Push to a test branch first, then merge to main
- **Debug failed workflows**: Check Actions tab, verify secrets are set correctly

### Theme Consistency

- Primary color: `#00D9FF` (cyan/teal) - used for titles and icons
- Accent color: `#FF6B6B` (red/coral) - used for highlights and fire effects
- Background: `#0D1117` (dark GitHub background)
- Text color: `#C9D1D9` (light gray)
- Theme: Dark theme with custom color palette (similar to Tokyo Night)
- All GitHub stats use `theme=dark` with `hide_border=true` and custom colors

## External Services Used

### GitHub Stats APIs

- **GitHub Stats**: `github-readme-stats-git-masterrstaa-rickstaa.vercel.app`
  - Used for: Main stats card, top languages, pinned repo cards
  - Configured with custom theme colors
- **Streak Stats**: `streak-stats.demolab.com`
  - Configured with dark background and custom cyan/red color scheme
- **Profile Views**: `komarev.com/ghpvc`
  - Simple view counter badge in cyan color
- **Snake Animation**: Generated by `Platane/snk/svg-only@v3` action
  - Stored in `output` branch (light and dark variants)
- **3D Contribution**: Generated by `yoshi389111/github-profile-3d-contrib@0.7.1` action
  - Multiple themes generated, `profile-night-rainbow.svg` used in README

### Badge Services

- **Social/Tech badges**: `img.shields.io` - standard badge format with custom colors
- All badges use `style=flat` for consistent appearance

## Important Guidelines

- Test all image/badge URLs before committing (they break frequently)
- The `output` branch contains snake animation SVGs only - do not modify directly
- The `profile-3d-contrib/` directory is auto-generated - changes will be overwritten
- Keep focus on Arabic/MENA market and regional relevance
- All workflows run automatically - manual intervention rarely needed
- When adding WakaTime stats, add markers `<!--START_SECTION:waka-->` and `<!--END_SECTION:waka-->` to README
